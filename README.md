The purpose of the app is to analyze tweeter data for the first 10 days of each variant. It provides 6 tabs: About, Dataframe, Sentiment, WordCloud, Heatmap, and Prediction. The About tab is an introduction page with the title and the description of the project. 

  The Dataframe tab displays the data through a criteria of filters (columns, variant, keyword, and date range). The component used for selecting columns is the function `st.multiselect()` where the user can select multiple values (columns) to click or unclick; `st.multiselect` is used instead of `st.selectbox` since a subset of the columns can exist in a dataframe. The variant also uses `st.mulitselect` since all variants exist in the dataframe. The date range utilizes a streamlit component called `st.date_input` on the column `created_at`; two `st.date_input` functions is used (one for start date and one for the end date where end date has to be larger than start date). The last component to address filter by keyword (text) is the `st.text_input`. Then, the text uses an SQL engine from the `SQLite3` module to extract rows where the `text` column contains the keyword. The next figure is a `st.selectbox` where the user can choose which visualization to display: correlation plot or scatterplot. If correlation plot is selected, a correlation heatmap is displayed from values -1 to 1. If the scatterplot is choosen, two `st.selectbox` components are generated where one represents the x-axis and the other one represents the y-axis for display of the 2D scatterplot. The list of columns to select from are `like_count`, `reply_count`, `retweet_count`, `followers_count`, `following_count`, `tweet_count`, `source`, `date`, `variant`, and `hour`.
